"""Refuse to let a retired figure survive in the prose.

Numbers move whenever a lane is rebuilt. Prose citing the old ones does not
announce itself: the sentence still reads fine, the table still lines up, and
nothing errors. That is the same silent-error shape this project exists to
catch, so it gets the same treatment -- a mechanical check rather than care.

`scripts/build_paper_metrics.py` records each figure's superseded values under
`retired_values`. This script scans the documents for them.

  python3 scripts/check_cited_numbers.py           report findings, exit 0
  python3 scripts/check_cited_numbers.py --strict  exit 1 if any are found

Two escape hatches, because some retired numbers belong in the text:
  * files in HISTORICAL are skipped -- they are logs of what changed
  * a line carrying the marker below is skipped
