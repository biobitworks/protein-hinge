# Protein Hinge

Protein Hinge is a dating app for drugs and rare diseases: the drugs already
exist, the diseases have been waiting forever, and somehow nobody has
introduced them. Type in a rare disease and we swipe through known
therapeutics — matching on broken biology, patient genetics, and trial
history — then tell you who's single, who's taken, and who got ghosted after
a failed Phase 3. And like any good matchmaker, we spill the tea *with
receipts*: every claim is hash-fingerprinted, so if anyone edits the evidence,
the ledger calls them out in front of everybody. No AI wingman makes the
call — plain, readable rules decide every match, and "we don't know" is a
respectable answer. Claim ceiling `REPURPOSING_HYPOTHESIS`: we set up the
date; we don't officiate the wedding.

Two custody lanes, one Merkle root — with a HealthOmics genetics lane feeding
the gap grading beside them.

## The project in plain language

**The pain point.** More than 90% of rare diseases have no approved treatment.
Drugs that already exist could help some of them, but nobody has tried — and
when a computer program does propose such a match, there is no way to check its
work. So companies re-run trials that already failed, promising leads sit
untried, and doctors cannot tell an auditable finding from a confident guess.

**What people in the field are doing.** Large AI efforts (TxGNN, Every Cure's
MATRIX program, commercial platforms like Healx) use machine learning to score
millions of drug–disease pairs, and subscription databases (Citeline, Cortellis)
sell the competitive landscape. They are good at ranking. They are black boxes:
no receipts, no record of which evidence produced a score, and no honest way to
say "we don't know."

**What we do.** Type in a rare disease; get back a table of existing drugs
graded by simple, readable rules as a genuine gap, already tried, or "we
cannot say" — with every piece of evidence fingerprinted so anyone can verify
nothing was invented or changed. The AI helps present; it never decides.

**The workflow — three phases: GATHER, GRADE, PROVE.**
Input: a rare disease name. Output: a graded drug–disease table with a
verifiable receipt on every row.

1. **GATHER** — ask five public sources one question each, hashing every
   response at capture: Open Targets (what biology is broken?), NCBI ClinVar
   loaded into an **AWS HealthOmics annotation store** (do patients carry
   pathogenic variants in these genes?), ClinicalTrials.gov (has this pairing
   been tried?), openFDA (is the drug approved?), and JUMP Cell Painting
   (does any compound push cells back toward the healthy state?).
   *Tech: Python, GraphQL/REST, NCBI E-utilities, boto3 + S3 + IAM +
   HealthOmics.*
2. **GRADE** — nine plain-Python rules (G000–G008) grade each pairing
   GAP / NOT_A_GAP / ABSTAIN. Abstentions are displayed at equal visual
   weight with results. No machine learning in the decision.
   *Tech: plain Python.*
3. **PROVE** — every record is SHA-256 content-addressed under one RFC 6962
   Merkle root, projected into SQLite, and verified **in the reader's own
   browser**; a tamper button shows a one-byte edit being caught live.
   *Tech: fcg.py, SQLite, sql.js (WebAssembly), vanilla JS.*

**AWS HealthOmics status, honestly:** the ClinVar subset (355 gene-specific
pathogenic-variant records for the eight consensus genes, all query digests
recorded, large multi-gene copy-number events excluded rather than counted)
is uploaded digest-keyed to the event account's HealthOmics S3 bucket, and
our own VEP annotation run executes on the account's HealthOmics workflow.
The event's service control policy denies the deprecated annotation-store
API; the dashboard's live probe records that denial as a receipt beside the
working workflow surface — in this system, "denied" is a first-class answer.

## What the project is

Elamipretide (SS-31) is a peptide. It got FDA accelerated approval for Barth
syndrome in September 2025, and it is a daily subcutaneous injection that does
not cross the blood–brain barrier.

The question is whether a **small molecule** exists that pushes cells in the
direction opposite to the cardiolipin/cristae genetic lesion. Not a peptide
mimic — SS-31 is not in the compound library and is never a comparator. The
pipeline compares compounds against the *genetic lesion*, using a consensus
axis built from eight independent knockouts rather than any single gene.

The claim ceiling is `REPURPOSING_HYPOTHESIS` and it is enforced in code.
**Predicted counter-perturbation is not measured rescue.**

## Run it

```bash
python3 db/build_db.py        # rebuild the SQLite projection from fcg/store/
node site/verify_test.js      # replay browser verification headlessly
python3 fto/fto.py            # registry status + the FTO_OPINION refusal
python3 db/serve.py 8787      # serve the local browser demo
```

Open `http://localhost:8787` after starting the demo server. Tabs deep-link:
`#omics` opens HealthOmics, `#prove` opens the tamper check, and so on.

### The AWS HealthOmics lane

```bash
python3 scripts/build_clinvar_evidence.py   # fetch the ClinVar subset (no AWS needed)
python3 scripts/healthomics_preflight.py    # redacted credential + store check
python3 scripts/setup_healthomics.py        # create bucket, role, store; import the TSV
```

The first script queries NCBI ClinVar for pathogenic / likely-pathogenic
variants in the eight consensus genes and writes
`data/healthomics/clinvar_subset.tsv` plus per-query digests. The setup script
(requires `aws configure`; hackathon user `elvish.an`, region `us-east-1`)
idempotently creates `s3://protein-hinge-omics-<account>`, an import IAM role,
and the `protein_hinge_clinvar` TSV/GENERIC annotation store, then runs the
import. TSV/GENERIC was a deliberate scoping choice over a VCF variant store:
a VCF store requires importing a full reference genome first, which buys
nothing for gene-level evidence within hackathon time. The dashboard's HealthOmics tab and its live probe
(`/api/healthomics`) render whatever state actually exists — including the
credentials-missing abstention.

## Disease Search + Agent FCO Demo

The dashboard now has two additional recording surfaces:

- `Disease Search`: disease-first rare disease repurposing finder. Prescripted Barth
  syndrome data works offline. The live option probes ClinicalTrials.gov and
  abstains from full gap grading until Open Targets and Convoke joins are
  wired.
- `GAP`: deterministic rare-disease gap grading lane under
  [GAP_LANE_SPEC.md](docs/GAP_LANE_SPEC.md). The current prescripted run emits
  `targets.csv`, `programs.csv`, `priors.csv`, `candidates.csv`,
  `abstentions.json`, and `receipt.json`.
- `AGENTS`: OpenAI fan-out receipts. Each subagent response is an FCO, the
  OpenAI model is an FCO, and the integration record tying those outputs into
  Protein Hinge is an FCO. These objects are projected into `fco_object` and
  `fco_edge` tables in the local SQLite database.
- `MODEL TRACE`: OpenAI and local-model trace surface. OpenAI ran the bounded
  subagent fan-out. Local Ollama models are inventoried by size and explicitly
  marked as available runtimes, not scientific data generators.
- `LOCAL JSON BEFORE WRITEBACK`: SeedGraph/FCO/Watchtower writeback candidates
  are saved locally in `docs/deferred_writeback_candidates.jsonl` and
  `model_trace/deferred_writeback_packet.json`. No live KG writeback is
  performed by this repo update.
- `@strands-agents/sdk` is installed and locked for the requested agent stack,
  though the verified fan-out path currently uses the OpenAI Responses API
  directly so it can write simple FCO receipts without extra runtime coupling.

Run the bounded fan-out only from a local ignored `.env`:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_openai_fanout.py --env-file .env --model gpt-4.1-nano --run-id 20260813Tfanout-elvis --max-workers 4
python3 scripts/build_agent_fanout_graph.py
python3 gap/ingest_gap.py
python3 scripts/build_model_trace.py
python3 scripts/capture_regulatory_sources.py
python3 scripts/build_regulatory_coverage.py
python3 scripts/aws_preflight.py
python3 db/build_db.py
```

The key and key hash are not written to the repo.

## Regulatory Coverage

Ingested and incorporated into the current evidence calculation:

- ClinicalTrials.gov: Barth syndrome, elamipretide, and cardiolipin queries.
- openFDA: elamipretide label and NDC records.

Captured as bounded official source surfaces, not full normalized ingestion:

- EMA medicines and orphan-designation workbooks.
- PMDA approved-products source page.
- FDA orphan designation search page.

Listed but not incorporated in this MVP:

- Full approved-drug coverage across FDA, Europe, and Japan.
- Normalized FDA orphan designation result rows.
- Normalized PMDA Japanese approval rows.
- Normalized EMA row joins to candidate programs.

The dashboard should describe these as future work unless source records and
receipts are added.

The dashboard `Regulatory Map` tab renders this boundary directly from
`model_trace/regulatory_coverage.json` plus the local registry tables, so the
demo can answer "what drug evidence is actually incorporated?" without
implying Europe/Japan/full-approved-drug coverage.

The received zip includes source builders (`fcg/ingest.py`,
`fcg/tamper_test.py`, and `fto/ingest_fto.py`), but those scripts reference a
local `HACKDAY_STATE.yaml` that was not included in the artifact. The committed
store, database projection, FTO refusal check, and browser verifier are the
self-contained reproducible path in this repo.

When the full ingest inputs are present, running `ingest.py` twice should
produce the same root. Timestamps are pinned to the observation date rather
than wall clock, because a node id is the hash of the node body and a live
clock would rename the whole graph on every run.

## The three rules

Applied identically at every depth. That identical application is what
"fractal" means here; it is not decoration.

**R1 — admit iff recomputes.** A node is admitted only if every input is
admitted and its own bytes recompute to its recorded digest.

**R2 — reject, do not annotate.** A node that fails R1 is rejected, not
admitted-with-a-warning. Rejection propagates to every descendant.

**R3 — route-comparable to the first divergent node.** "What broke" is answered
with a node id, not with a shrug.

## Two kinds of source, never conflated

`add_source_local` holds the bytes. Evidence level **RECOMPUTED**.

`add_source_attested` holds only a digest captured at the point of origin — the
honest record for a 13 MB parquet on someone else's S3 bucket. It asserts: at
this instant, that URI served exactly these bytes. Anyone can re-fetch and
check. Evidence level **COMMITTED**, because we do not hold the bytes and
saying otherwise would be a lie.

35 of 41 science-lane sources are attested. All 13 JUMP plates and all 6
metadata files returned HTTP 200 at capture.

## The tamper test has two arms

A ledger that never rejects anything is decoration. There are exactly two ways
to alter this graph and both are tested.

**Arm A — change the bytes, leave the record.** Recomputation fails, the claim
three layers up is rejected without being touched, and the rejection names the
first divergent node. The Merkle root does *not* move, and that is correct: the
root commits to what the graph *claims*, not to what is on disk.

**Arm B — change the bytes and repair the record.** The cover-up. Recomputation
now passes. But a node id is the hash of its record, so repairing the record
renames the node, and renaming the node moves the root.

The point is the conjunction. Arm A trips recomputation. Arm B trips the root.
**No edit survives both.** All eight assertions pass.

## On the partner receipt

`biobitworks/aws-biopharma` publishes a Merkle receipt with six digests and a
root, but does not declare the tree convention. Standard families were tested —
RFC 6962, duplicate-last, carry-odd, sorted-pair, raw and hex concatenation —
and none reproduced the stated root.

This is not an accusation. Nothing suggests the root is wrong. It says the
receipt is missing one field, and that field is the difference between
COMMITTED and RECOMPUTED. `verify_receipt()` encodes exactly that: a receipt
with no declared convention returns `COMMITTED`, with the note that the root is
asserted rather than proven. Ours declares `rfc6962/sha256`, its leaf and node
hash construction, and its leaf order.

The fix on their side is four fields.

## The finding that most affects the project

All eight consensus genes return **zero** small-molecule tractability buckets
and **zero** drug or clinical candidates in Open Targets. EGFR, queried
identically as a positive control, returns five SM buckets and 82 candidates —
so the field works and the zeros are real.

This is the strongest argument for the method: you cannot run structure-based
design against a protein with no ligandable pocket, but a phenotype-first
ranking does not need one.

It is also the sharpest caveat on any result: there is no reference chemistry
against this module, so no positive-control compound exists to validate the
axis and no prior art exists to catch a wrong hit.

Both halves are in the graph, on the same node.

## Not legal advice

`fto/` produces a reproducible clearance *search record*, capped at
`CLEARANCE_SEARCH_RECORD`. It refuses to emit `FTO_OPINION` — that is a legal
conclusion issued by qualified counsel who signs their name to it. The level
exists in the enum so the code can decline it out loud rather than by omission.

See `fto/FTO_DESIGN.md`.

## Credentials

Never in this repo. `.env` only. Convoke is listed and deliberately not wired:
we do not hold `CONVOKE_MCP_TOKEN`, and a source whose query surface nobody has
documented cannot be recomputed by a third party, so it cannot be admitted.

## Data

Cell Painting Gallery / JUMP `cpg0016`, released **CC0 1.0 Universal**. Citation
is an ethical obligation rather than a license condition, and we honor it: the
JUMP dataset paper and Weisbart et al. 2024 for the Gallery.

CC0 on a morphological profile says nothing about rights in the molecule it
depicts. That is the trapdoor, and it is why the FTO lanes are tracked
separately.
